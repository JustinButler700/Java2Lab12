This was created in Java Level 2 By Justin Butler at MSJC.
This code is free to reuse, and I don't need credit.
However, please do not use it for school assignments/plagiarize.

Some notable comments regarding errors i made in the creation of this:

1. I use my ones() as a field rather than refining my method call.
2. my ternary operator can be simplified to "if(input % 2 != 0) { count++; }"

I was still learning when making  this, so if you are using my code please
take note of all of these errors.
